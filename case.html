    <h1>Pokédex App Case Study</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Pokédex is a web app, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that
        loads data from an external API. Users are able to select and view
        details about any Pokémon.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
      <p>Pokédex was a project I built as part of my web development course at
        CareerFoundry. I had to build a complete, fully functioning JavaScript
        web application.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>The aim of the project was to introduce me to JavaScript and the use of
        an API. The goal was to develop an app using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
        that would retrieve data from an external API.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>I started to build the app interface using JavaScript to create the
        necessary functions that would load data from an external API, view
        that list of Pokémon, and, upon clicking on a list item, show detailed
        data about the selected Pokémon.
        <br><br>
        The app also needed styling using the CSS framework, Bootstrap. It was
        important that the app was responsive to different screen sizes and I
        wanted the design to look clean and fun.
        <br><br>
        When a Pokémon was selected, the details had to pop up which I also
        wanted to keep clean and simple.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The Pokédex project was a fun introduction to JavaScript as well as
        APIs. I did find the amount of new information quite daunting but it
        was good to go through the various processes required to build such an
        app. It was also a great opportunity to work with Bootstrap.
        <br><br>
        I am also really grateful to my tutor for his helpful input and general
        guidance with the project. My mentor also gave some valuable feedback
        on how I could improve the app which I plan to implement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Duration</h2>
      <p>The development of the project was completed within the estimated
        timeframe Career Foundry suggests - 45 hours.
